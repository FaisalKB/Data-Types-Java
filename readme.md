# Data Types in Java 

## About:
I will be documenting my Java Journey through GitHub Repositories to showcase my advancement in the language. As I went through learning JavaScript, Node and React, I found myself regretting not documenting and showing my advancement through the language. I aim to change that while I learn Java, and hope that once I become a great programmer and developer, I can look back and be reminded of my roots. 

Each ReadMe will include this about section, as well as a brief description of the repository, what it does and why it's important.

## Description:
*Data Type* describes the context given to information in our program. We typically understand information when given some context. For example, `100` and `"one hundred"`, technically mean the same thing, but we would use the number representation and the word representation in different contexts. Similarly, we can provide this type of context in our programs. This can help us in various ways, such as clarifying what type of data to use and when, saving memory, and more! This repo showcases various data types, attached to variables.
